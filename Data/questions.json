	"question": "You find a lost wallet on the street. What do you do?",
	"answer": {
	  "good": "Try to find the owner and return it.",
	  "evil": "Take the money and toss the wallet."
	},
	"outcome": {
	  "good": "You track down the owner and return the wallet intact. They’re grateful and might even offer you a reward—though, let’s be real, you’d have done it anyway.",
	  "evil": "You pocket the cash and toss the wallet like yesterday’s trash. No consequences, no guilt—just a little extra spending money. Hey, finders keepers, right?"
	}

  {
	"question": "A stray dog follows you home. What do you do?",
	"answer": {
	  "good": "Give it food and find it a home.",
	  "evil": "Scare it away by throwing rocks."
	},
	"outcome": {
	  "good": "The dog happily wags its tail as you feed it and call a shelter—or maybe you just keep it. Either way, congrats on being a good person and possibly gaining a new furry best friend!",
	  "evil": "You chuck a rock, and the dog runs off, scared and confused. No barks, no bites—just a sad look as it disappears. But hey, at least your doorstep is dog-free, right?"

	  "good": "The kid’s eyes light up as they get a fresh scoop of ice cream. You’re officially their hero for the day. Feels nice, doesn’t it?",
	  "evil": "The kid stares at their fallen ice cream, then at you, teary-eyed. You, however, are too busy chuckling at their misfortune. What a truly inspiring display of empathy."

  {
	"question": "You find an ancient, mysterious book in the library. What do you do?",
	"answer": {
	  "good": "Read it carefully and try to learn from it.",
	  "evil": "Rip out a page just to see what happens."
	},
	"outcome": {
	  "good": "You dive into the book’s knowledge, uncovering secrets long forgotten. Maybe it’s magic, maybe it’s just a history lesson—either way, you just got a little wiser.",
	  "evil": "You tear out a page, and absolutely nothing happens. Except now a librarian somewhere has a mild but inexplicable hatred for you."

	  "good": "You help them up, and they give you a grateful nod. You feel a small sense of pride in your action and suddendly the day just feels brighter.",
		"evil": "You laugh so hard you almost trip yourself. That was genuinely hilarious. The way they flailed? Priceless. No regrets—comedy gold like that doesn’t come around every day."

	},
	"outcome": {
	  "good": "They appreciate your honesty and end up choosing a better outfit. Crisis averted, and you remain a trusted fashion advisor.",
	  "evil": "They walk out confidently, completely unaware of the disaster they’re wearing. You, meanwhile, get to enjoy the aftermath of your little social experiment."

	  "good": "Wait patiently for the next light.",
	  "evil": "Sprint across like it’s an action movie."
	},
	"outcome": {
	  "good": "You wait like a responsible adult. Boring? Maybe. But also much less likely to involve a hospital visit.",
	  "evil": "You make it across just in time, heart pounding like you just outran a car chase. Was it reckless? Absolutely. Did it look cool? Hell yeah!"
	}

  {
	"question": "You’re at a party, and someone brings out a karaoke machine. What do you do?",
	"answer": {
	  "good": "Join in and sing a fun song.",

  },
  "outcome": {
	"good": "You keep it classy, containing the explosion like a true professional. No one glares at you, and you walk out of the elevator with your dignity intact.",
	"evil": "You unleash it with full force. The silence afterward is deafening. The fear in their eyes? Incredible. You have established dominance."
  }
},
{
  "question": "You're driving, and someone is waiting to cross the street. What do you do?",
  "answer": {
	"good": "Stop and let them cross.",
	"evil": "Speed up slightly just to make them hesitate."
  },
  "outcome": {
	"good": "You stop, they cross, and they give you a little wave of gratitude. How nice of them.",
	"evil": "You don’t actually hit them, but the way they do that awkward ‘should I go or not’ shuffle is pure entertainment. Power move executed flawlessly."
